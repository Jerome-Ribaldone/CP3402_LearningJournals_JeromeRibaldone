# Learning Journal Week 3
## Week 3
## Learning Activities  
This week, I practiced using the CMS WordPress. The practical task for this week was to create a WordPress site and make 
some changes. For this practical, I recreated the site from Practical 1 inside WordPress. While this is not my first time 
using WordPress, I rediscovered that WordPress is a much easier CMS to use. With the templates and patterns available, 
creating a site was a breeze. Most of the site was created without having to look up too much, although there were a few 
aspects, such as the site logo, that I did have to look up to change.
Altogether, I think WordPress is much superior to Joomla in terms of ease of use, based on my experience.
Another learning activity we did this week was a group interview for the second assessment task. This experience was 
different as I don't normally interact with people in class. Conducting interviews was a change for me. From the interviews, 
I found them to be too short to really determine whether each individual would be an appropriate choice for a group member. 
This could also be due to my questions being too technical or too advanced. For example, asking "Have you tried using Docker 
or Vagrant yet?" was content for next week's practical, so obviously most or all people had not tried this yet.
This week I haven't revised any content other than the content for the practical.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Learning WordPress or having some experience may have benefit to employability in the future. WordPress.org is widely using CMS
having some experience may be useful in the future. Interacting with peers is a good experience and learning about your peers 
and their skill sets is important for cooperation in the workplace and practicing these skill will hopefully help me in the future
