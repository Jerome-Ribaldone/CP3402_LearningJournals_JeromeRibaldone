# Learning Journal Week 2
## Week 2
## Learning Activities
This week's learning activities were focused on the practical due to a busy schedule. Consequently, I only had time to work on the practical and learning journal, although I did manage to have a brief look into Docker.
The task of this week's practical was to learn and deploy a Joomla CMS website to a live host. For this task, I opted to use Sitegrounds instead of spending time figuring it out myself; I decided it would be easier to use Siteground's easy-to-set-up service.
After the Joomla site was set up, I looked over the admin panel and made a few changes to experiment and discover features.

## Content Insights

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
This week I have not gained any employability insights due to the unlikeness of myself working on a Joomla 4 CMS in the future
