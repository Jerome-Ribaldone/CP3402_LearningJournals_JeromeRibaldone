## Estimated Hours
This week I have only spent around 3-4 hour going over the group assessment content and setup
## Content Insights
This week, I had my first group meeting for the assessment. We focused on setting up various tools. We established a GitHub Repository, a Trello Board, Slack, and Discord. In Discord, we ensured that the channels were appropriately organized to facilitate content management throughout the project. For the Trello board, we were provided with a template, and we filled out the group agreement and contacts card. One issue I encountered while working with Trello was that multiple people trying to edit the same card could result in overwritten work. Consequently, I had to rewrite some sections multiple times.

Only GitHub was integrated into the Slack channel, which was a straightforward process requiring a single command. As for the GitHub Repository, we've only set up the documentation mark thus far. During the meeting, we negotiated the weekly meeting times and decided on 7 PM on Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Collaborating with others for group assessments provides valuable experience for the future workplace. The IT industry, in particular, heavily relies on collaboration for large-scale projects.
