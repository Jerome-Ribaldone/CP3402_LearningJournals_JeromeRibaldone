## Estimated Hours
This week I have only spent around 3-4 hour going over the group assessment content and setup
## Content Insights
This week I had my first group meeting for the assessment, this week we did some of the setup. We set up the GitHub Repository, 
Trello Board, Slack and Discord. In discord, we made sure the discord was set up with the appropriate channels to make sure 
content will be organised throughout the project. The Trello board we wer given a template, so we filled out the group agreement and contacts card, 
the issue I came across when working with trello was when multiple people are trying to edit the same card work can get overwritten, because of this
I rewrote some sections multiple times. Slack only GitHub was integrated into the channel, this was an easy process which requires a single command. 
In the GitHub Repository so far on the documentation mark is set up. During the meeting we negotiated what the weekly meeting times will be we decide on
7pm Monday, Wednesday Thursday.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Collaborating with people for group assessments is great experience for the future in the workplace, IT is an industry that heavily relies on collaboration for massive projects.
