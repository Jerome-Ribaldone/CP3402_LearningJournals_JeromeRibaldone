## Estimated Hours
 I spent 3-4 hours of my time learn how to use and deploy a local environment using docker, 
 this is not including the time I have spent on the assignment
## Content Insights
This week, I looked into using Docker to deploy a local environment. Despite this not being my first time attempting to 
deploy a CMS locally, I knew that Docker was the best choice for this task. Although I had previous experience with Docker, 
I still encountered some difficulties and learning curves. For example, during the setup process of deploying, I had forgotten 
that Docker required dependencies such as WordPress, MariaDB, PHPMyAdmin, etc., in order to deploy properly. Additionally, I had 
forgotten how to pull those dependencies. A Problem I ran into was that most online tutorials had not mentioned this requirement. To address 
this issue, I reviewed several videos until one had included has set up portion.

The YAML file caused difficulties as well. The issue was that the `docker-compose.yml` file was not properly saving as a YAML file. 
The solution I found was to open the WordPress directory in PHPStorm and then create the `docker-compose.yml` file in PHPStorm.
## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Docker has emerged as a popular choice in the tech industry. Because of this, I believe it is a wise decision to familiarize 
myself with Docker and learn how it works. This way, in case a job I seek requires or prefers experience with Docker, I'll be better prepared.
