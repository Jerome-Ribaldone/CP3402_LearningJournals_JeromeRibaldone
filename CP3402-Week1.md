# Learning Journal Week 1
## Week 1
## Learning Activities
This week, I set up a GitHub Pages website. The goal of this task was to refresh my skills in CSS and HTML, as well as to learn how to deploy a website to a live service. During this task, I experimented with using online AI tools to help create images and content to flesh out the website. Some online resources I used were ChatGPT, which was used to generate website text content to make it look more content-rich. Another online resource I used was Craiyon.com and Pixlir.com. These were used to create images based on text prompts given.
I used these tools to create unique images for the website, given the unique idea of a toast that takes selfies and toasts that image onto the toast. The online tool that I found helpful for this site development was "This Person Does Not Exist," a site that generates random images of people who don't exist. This was used to generate headshot images for the staff of the company.
After I finished the practical, I decided to revise some coding languages. This week, I chose to focus on PHP. My reasoning for starting with PHP, despite it not being needed until later in the subject, was due to PHP being one of the lacking coding languages in my previous attempts at this subject. I used codecademy.com to learn the basics of PHP and have completed the first module of this course.

## Estimated Hours
- **Practical -** 3 Hours
- **Learning Journal -** 1 Hour
- **Revision -** 3 Hours
## Content Insights
- Markdown is a fantastic tool for providing detailed explanations or instructions in an IT Environment.
- The Use of AI for to shorten tasks allowed me to spend more time on other task such as website development
- PHP seems like a good tool for server-side development but i'll have to practice more inorder to comprehend just how good of a language it is
## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Relearning how to deploy a simple HTML and CSS site was a good experience, as practicing or revisiting old skills is something that most 
people should do, as skills can dull or be forgotten over time. Experimenting with online AI tools to create a website was an interesting 
experiment and will be a great tool to use in the future. AI was a great help in generating both text and image content for this site. 
However, while AI can also be used to generate coding content, it is not something to rely on. I should learn and develop these skills in 
order to become a better IT professional.
