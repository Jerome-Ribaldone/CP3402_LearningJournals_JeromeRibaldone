## Week 1
## Learning Activities
This week I set up a GitHub pages website, the goal of this task was to refresh my skills on css and html as well as learn how to deploy a website to a live service.
During this task I experimented  with using online AI tools to help create images and content to flesh out the website. Some online resourse i use were ChatGPT, which was used to give 
website text content to help make it look more content rich. Another online resource I used was Craiyon.com and Pixlir.com these were used to create image based on text prompts given.
i used this to create unique images for this website due to the unique idea of a Toast the takes selfies and toast that image into the toast. The online tool that i found to help with this 
site development was this person does not exist site which is a site that generates a random image of people who don't exist.
